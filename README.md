Tetris_JG_Project v5
I'm not exactly sure since this project is almost a year old and I followed guides when creating it, but you will need to download Python and Pygame.
"In my Tetris game, there are a few 'features/bugs' where the shape of the pieces completely changes when rotating or moving them. During development, there were some issues, but I decided to leave them as is. I would appreciate it if anyone can fix them."
